# Basic Setup for Ubuntu
Sick of installing all the packages you need individually? Run ./quick_install.sh

## Steps
1. Might need to run `chmod +x quick_install.sh` to ensure that the script is executable
2. In the directory where the script is located, run `./quick_install.sh`

Do note that the script is not fully automatic. You may need to press the commands on screen accordingly to continue the installations.
